# MicroservicesStarter

PoC on having microservices with using YARP as an application entry point and authorization/users service which is responsible for all authentication stuff.
Very nice primer for future projects as it uses devcontainer approach, so the environment is mobile.

Had fun. Let's see if it comes in handy in the future.
